Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data.

Deep learning is a branch of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) allows machines to understand and process human language.

Vector databases store embeddings and enable fast similarity search.

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval and generation to improve LLM responses.
